## Overview

The Mare is the generic European term for nightmare spirits found across Germanic, Slavic, and Scandinavian cultures. The English word **"nightmare" literally means "night-mare"**—a night visit from the Mare spirit, NOT referring to a female horse.

This entity is believed to sit on or "ride" sleeping victims like a horse, oppressing their breathing and inducing terrifying dreams and paralysis. Across European folklore, the Mare can manifest as a demonic entity or, in some traditions, as the involuntarily wandering soul of a living person.

The Mare represents one of the most widespread and linguistically influential folklore entities, with variants appearing across nearly all European cultures as a cultural interpretation of the universal human experience of sleep paralysis.

## Etymology: Not a Horse!

### The Great Misconception

**NIGHTMARE ≠ A BAD DREAM ABOUT HORSES**

Many modern English speakers mistakenly think "nightmare" relates to horses (mare = female horse). This is a **coincidental homonym**—the words have completely different origins.

### Two Different "Mares"

| Mare (horse) | Mare (demon) |
|--------------|--------------|
| Old English: *mere* | Old English: *mære* |
| Meaning: female horse | Meaning: nightmare demon |
| Origin: Germanic horse word | Origin: Proto-Indo-European *mor- (to harm) |
| **UNRELATED WORDS** | **← This is in "nightmare"** |

### The Real Etymology

**Nightmare = "Night" + "Mare" (the demon)**

**Proto-Indo-European**: *mor- (to rub away, harm)
↓
**Proto-Germanic**: *marōn (nightmare spirit)
↓
**Old English**: mære (demon, incubus)
↓
**Modern English**: mare in "night-mare"

## Cultural Variations Across Europe

The Mare appears in nearly every European culture:

### Germanic Regions
- **Mara/Mahr** (German): Female nightmare spirit
- **Alp** (German/Austrian): Male nightmare demon with magic hat
- **Emphasis**: Shapeshifting, magic hats, counting compulsions

- **Kikimora** (Russian): Related house spirit
- **Emphasis**: Soul wandering, involuntary Maras, physical identification

### Scandinavian Regions
- **Mara/Mora** (Swedish, Norwegian, Danish): Nightmare spirit

### British Isles

- **Emphasis**: Hag imagery, witchcraft connections

---

## The "Riding" Metaphor

### Why "Riding"?

The Mare is said to **ride** sleepers, explaining the name structure:

**Night-mare** = The Mare that rides at night

**Riding Imagery**:
- Sits astride the sleeper's chest
- "Rides" them like riding a horse
- Leaves victim exhausted as if they'd been ridden hard
- Germanic verb "reiten" (to ride) often used

This explains why the entity sits on the chest—it's riding the sleeper.

---

## Folklore: The Wandering Soul

### Soul Travel Tradition

In some European traditions, the Mare is not an external demon but a person's spirit:

**Characteristics of Human Mares**:
- Soul leaves body during sleep
- Wanders involuntarily at night
- Attacks sleepers without conscious intent
- Person may be unaware during waking hours

**Identification Signs**:
- Exhaustion despite sleep
- Disheveled appearance upon waking
- Sweating during sleep
- Born with caul or under specific conditions

**Trapping Method**: Securing or confining the suspected Mare's physical body prevents their soul from wandering.

## Protection Methods

### Traditional European Protections

| Method | Description | Widespread Use |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Iron objects | Iron under pillow or near bed | Pan-European |
| Horseshoes | Iron horseshoe above door | Germanic/British |
| Block entry | Plug keyholes, seal openings | Pan-European |
| Christian symbols | Crosses, prayers, holy water | Post-Christian Europe |
| Shoes backwards | Toes pointing away from bed | Germanic/Slavic |
| Broom by door | Mare must count straws until dawn | Germanic |
| Garlic | Hung in room | Slavic |
| Knife under pillow | Iron/steel blade protection | Various |

### The Counting Compulsion

Like many European spirits, the Mare (in some traditions) has a compulsion to count objects. Placing a broom by the door or scattering seeds forces the Mare to count every item, keeping it occupied until sunrise when it must flee.

## Scientific Explanation

### Sleep Paralysis

The Mare represents European cultural interpretation of **sleep paralysis**:

**Mare Attack** → **Medical Reality**
- "Mare sitting on chest" → Hallucinated pressure during REM atonia
- "Cannot move" → REM paralysis persisting into waking
- "Cannot breathe" → Perception of restricted breathing
- "Terrifying presence" → Hypnagogic hallucination
- "Riding sensation" → Cultural interpretation of pressure

**Status**: Traditional folklore explaining well-documented parasomnia

### Universal Experience, Local Interpretation

Sleep paralysis affects all human populations. The Mare is Europe's interpretation of this universal physiological phenomenon.

## The Linguistic Legacy

### How the Word Survived

The Mare is one of the most successful folklore entities linguistically:

1. **Ancient demon** → Causes nightmares
2. **Word formation** → "Night-mare" for demon attack
3. **Meaning shift** → From demon to the dream itself
4. **Supernatural fades** → Medical understanding replaces belief
5. **Word survives** → "Nightmare" used daily, origin forgotten

### Modern Usage

**Daily Impact**:
- Billions of people use "nightmare" regularly
- Few know it means "night-demon"
- Original supernatural meaning preserved only in folklore studies
- Successful transition from supernatural to psychological term
