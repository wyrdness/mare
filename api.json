      "full": "The Mare is the generic European term for nightmare spirits found across Germanic, Slavic, and Scandinavian cultures. The English word 'nightmare' literally means 'night-mare'—a night visit from the Mare spirit, not referring to a female horse. This entity is believed to sit on or 'ride' sleeping victims like a horse, oppressing their breathing and inducing terrifying dreams and paralysis. Across European folklore, the Mare can manifest as a demonic entity or, in some traditions, as the involuntarily wandering soul of a living person. Folk beliefs held that the Mare could be trapped by securing the suspected person's body, preventing their spirit from wandering. Protection methods included iron objects, horseshoes, plugging keyholes to prevent entry, and Christian symbols. The Mare represents one of the most widespread and linguistically influential folklore entities, with variants appearing across nearly all European cultures as a cultural interpretation of the universal human experience of sleep paralysis."
